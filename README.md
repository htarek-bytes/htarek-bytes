<h1 align="center">Hello 👋, I'm Tarek</h1>
<h3 align="center">Just a random guy obsessed with the "Why" behind every "How".</h3>

<p width="80%">
  I genuinely enjoy viewing the world as a massive, interconnected system waiting to be deconstructed.<br>
  I treat knowledge like a graph, kind of like a spider web. My goal is to build this spider web of understanding where every new concept is connected to a foundational principle I already know.
  It makes life challenging and very fun.
</p>
  <h4 align="center">I love finding shortcuts.</h4>
<p>
  I believe that if you understand the fundamental pattern of one system, you already understand half of another. I used data transmission concepts to learn electricity, physical analogies to understand gravity, pressure and other phenomenons.<br> <br>

  <h4 align="center">Its all about the dots...</h4>
  
 <p> My goal isn't just to learn a concepts. I think that stopping there is missing out on some dense, fruitful learning opportunities. The real goldmine is to find the underlying pattern so I never have to learn it again.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on: [The environmental Black Box: Embedded flight recorder](https://github.com/htarek-bytes/ESP32-S3-N8R8/) *(baseline committed, hardware incoming)*
  
- 🌱 I'm currently learning: **ESP32, STM32, Electronics, RTOS**
  
- 🧠 Recent rabbit holes:
  - **1:1 correspondences in the wild:** Using data transmission (packets, bandwidth, latency) to reverse-engineer electricity.
    
  - **RTOS scheduling:** Treating task prioritization like CPU cache eviction policies
